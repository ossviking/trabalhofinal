  # Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies are creating circular references when checking user roles
    - Policies on maintenance_tasks and other tables are querying the users table
    - This creates infinite recursion when the users table itself has RLS enabled

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing policies that cause recursion
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies
    - Use auth.uid() directly instead of querying users table for role checks
    - Temporarily simplify access control to avoid recursion

  3. Tables affected
    - users: Simplified to basic user access
    - maintenance_tasks: Removed role-based restrictions temporarily
    - reservations: Simplified policies
    - resources: Simplified policies
